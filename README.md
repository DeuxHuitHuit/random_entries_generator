### DELEGATES ###

This extension also provides developers with two delegates,
`EntriesPreCreateRandomData` and `EntriesPostCreateRandomData`.
Delegates are fire once per field and offers developer the ability to change field and/or generated data. Check the
[FieldAdapter::generateData() method](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/random_entries_generator/blob/master/lib/class.fieldadapter.php) for more information on those delegates.

### Help, my field is blank!!! ###

In order to generate data for a particular field, this extension requires a [field adapter](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/random_entries_generator/blob/master/lib/class.fieldadapter.php)
that will populate the data in the database.

If a field stays blank, it's probably because the adapter for it does not exists. If the adapter does exists,
it is also possible that it does not cover all cases.

You can [look here](https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/random_entries_generator/tree/master/lib/adapters)
to see if there is already an adapter for the field in question. If not, feel free
to implement it (it's really easy!) and send a Pull Request.
